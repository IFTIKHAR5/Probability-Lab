-------------------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------
This project implements fundamental probability concepts using pure Python.
The main goal of this lab is to understand the mathematical foundations of
probability and translate them into executable Python code without relying
on external libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or Pandas.

The project focuses on clarity, logic building, and real-world applications
of probability, which are essential skills for Data Science, Artificial
Intelligence, and Machine Learning.

-------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVES OF THE LAB
-------------------------------------------------
1. Implement core probability formulas using Python
2. Understand probability theory through coding
3. Practice problem-solving with mathematical concepts
4. Build strong foundations for data science and AI
5. Learn how simulations work internally

-------------------------------------------------
PROJECT STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------
The repository contains separate Python files for each task:

- task1_basic_probability.py
  Implements the basic probability formula with error handling.

- task2_probability_types.py
  Implements classical, empirical, and subjective probability concepts.

- task3_event_relationships.py
  Analyzes mutually exclusive, independent events and conditional probability.

- task4_probability_rules.py
  Implements addition, multiplication, and complement probability rules.

- task5_card_simulation.py
  Simulates card draws and compares experimental vs theoretical probability.

- task6_bayes_theorem.py
  Implements Bayes’ Theorem using a BayesianUpdater class.

- reflection.txt
  Contains challenges faced and lessons learned during the lab.

-------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMS
-------------------------------------------------
Each task is independent and can be run separately.

Example:
python task1_basic_probability.py
python task2_probability_types.py
python task3_event_relationships.py
python task4_probability_rules.py
python task5_card_simulation.py
python task6_bayes_theorem.py

-------------------------------------------------
KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
-------------------------------------------------
- Basic Probability
- Classical Probability
- Empirical Probability
- Subjective Probability
- Mutually Exclusive Events
- Independent Events
- Conditional Probability
- Probability Rules
- Simulation and Experimental Probability
- Bayes’ Theorem and Bayesian Updating

-------------------------------------------------
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------
The outputs printed in each Python file demonstrate how probability values
change based on different conditions, events, and evidence. Experimental
results from simulations are compared with theoretical probabilities to
validate probability laws.

-------------------------------------------------
LEARNING OUTCOMES
-------------------------------------------------
After completing this lab, I am able to:
1. Convert probability formulas into Python code
2. Implement probability simulations from scratch
3. Understand probability mathematically and programmatically
4. Apply probability to real-world problems
5. Prepare for advanced data science libraries

-------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE
-------------------------------------------------
This lab intentionally avoids external libraries to ensure a deep
understanding of probability principles before using automated tools.

-------------------------------------------------
